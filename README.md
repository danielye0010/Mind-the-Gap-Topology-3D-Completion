# Topology-Aware Point Cloud Completion

This repository contains the implementation of **Topo-PCN**, a topology-augmented point cloud completion framework designed to handle structural corruptions such as holes. The project also includes the implementation of a custom benchmark, **ModelNet-Topology**, which extends ModelNet with topological corruptions and annotations.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

- **Baseline Model:** Point Completion Network (PCN)
- **Proposed Model:** Topo-PCN (PCN + topology features + topology loss)
- **Comparison Model:** Point-Attention (Transformer-based)
- **Benchmark:** Modified ModelNet with topological corruptions
- **Input:** Incomplete point clouds with associated 3D topology vectors
- **Output:** Dense completed point clouds
